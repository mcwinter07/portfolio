# Design Process

## Insperation
Inspired by concept of digital nomadry I decided to play on the themes of adventure, trekking, and exploration, and link it back to the concept of mobile working.

When looking for imagery, I sought out inspiration from ismotetric graphic design, outdoor photography, and screens from 8-bit adventure games.

## Logo Decisions

Attempting to encapsulate the feeling of adventure and new horizons, my design depict a rising sun behind two mountains. The silhouette created also  defines a soft M, which when inverse is also my initils.

## Colour Scheme

I aimed to keep to a cooler colour scheme, with heavy contrast with coral red and yolk yellow highlight on the desing elements.

## Visibility

Working against a dark blue background, the use of bone white created ample contrast for readability.


# Development Process


working from scetches I created a design in adobe illustrator and create the svg assets I would need.

## Succuss


While I was happy with the overall layout I struggle working with alignment when pushed to web.

In a very specific case, my site (sizing aside) did work on responsive design on firefox.



## Challanges

Working with so many nested grids withion on page I found that alignment often reacted in unexpected ways, especially when working with the contact form.

With the time constraints I was not able to look into the alignment issues I was experiencing

## Future Improvements

future plans for development include:
• redesigning the css include main page on a single css grid as apposed to multiple
• correcting alignment
• introducing an overlay nav
• introduce a horizontal slider for the preview
